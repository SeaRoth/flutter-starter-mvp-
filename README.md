# Flutter starter MVP architecture with Google Sign In

This app is under development and approximately 82% complete.

If you plan on using this starter kit then make sure you register it with Firebase/Google and download the google-services.json otherwise the app won't load. I will have to fix this part later for users who don't necessarily want the login portion.

Features:
 - MVP architecture
 - Save data locally (cart & statistics)
 - Connects to firebase
 - Sign in with Google
 
This app updates state using interfaces, overrides and setState.
